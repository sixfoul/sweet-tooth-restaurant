<h2> Ordering Food System for Sweet Tooth Restaurant </h2>

This project was intended for a project for the Web Application Development course during my Diploma studies. 
XAMPP was used as a local host, with elements of PHP, HTML, CSS, and Javascript implemented into the program.
The images in this project were not commercially used.

The functional requirements within the program are as such:
<li> User Information </li>

example, the user’s username, user’s password, and user’s phone
number.

information. For example, the food’s id, food name, food price, food

The website or system shall generate checkout information, where the
chosen food will be displayed in one page. For example, food name,
